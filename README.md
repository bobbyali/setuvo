*setuvo*
======

*setuvo* is an algorithm for semi-automatically segmenting the boundaries ofsubcutaneous tumor from micro-Computed Tomography (3D X-ray) images.

This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-e5GzNiojY) shows a 3D rendering of a tumor segmentation result generated by *setuvo*.

The main paper that describes *setuvo* is:

* "Semi-automatic segmentation of subcutaneous tumours from micro-computed tomography images", Physics in Medicine and Biology, 2013 [link](http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/58/22/8007)

The main Matlab application is in the "Main" folder. Read the README.txt file first.

The MEX code is in the "Mex" folder. You may need to compile this first before running the main application.
